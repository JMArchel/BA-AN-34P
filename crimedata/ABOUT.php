                    The crime interactive website or management system will consist mainly of data and records that
                    Dumaguete City Police Station has provided; the data will be placed in a database.
                    This website will also be customized based on the office's suggestions.
                    For security purposes, the employees or people of the vice mayor can access the website after registering their name and password.
                    Data visualization outputs will also be shown in the system, such as heat maps, bar charts, and line graphs
                    since these are convenient to view and understand the trends or patterns of information.
